# Electronic_Sales_Analysis_USA
Data Analysis on Sales Data in US States.

This Repo contains "Solving real world data science videos with Python Pandas!"

In this project we I use Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyse and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

Started by cleaning our data, Tasks during this section include:

* Drop NaN values from Dataframe
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
